    <section>
        <p>I&#39;m <strong>Nick McKinnis</strong>, a passionate technical game designer with a deep love for crafting immersive and innovative gaming experiences. My journey into game development began in 2012, where I honed my skills as a narrative designer, weaving stories that captivate and engage. By 2018, my career evolved as I embraced freelancing in technical roles, allowing me to dive into the intricate details of game design.</p>
        <p>As a <strong>Unity specialist</strong> and <strong>pixel artist</strong>, I&#39;ve spent countless hours perfecting shaders and developing complex gameplay systems that bring games to life. My expertise has led me to take on the role of <strong>Chief Design Officer at Digital Scorpion Interactive</strong>, where I&#39;ve had the privilege of leading a talented team to release <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tales-of-valoris/id6471588957">Tales Of Valoris</a> on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tales-of-valoris/id6471588957">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DigitalScorpionInteractive.TalesOfValorisSwallowsDefenders&hl=en_US">Android</a>, and launch a demo for our upcoming title <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366690/Hit_N_Bit/">Hit N&#39; Bit</a> on Steam. Currently, we&#39;re hard at work on an exciting port and expansion of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3059570/Tales_of_Valoris_Swallows_Defenders/">Tales Of Valoris</a> for Steam, pushing the boundaries of what our game can achieve.</p>
        <p>But my passion doesn&#39;t stop there—I thrive on challenges, which is why I regularly participate in game jams, where creativity and speed are put to the test. Here are a few projects I&#39;m particularly proud of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://nickmckinnis.itch.io/revenge-of-the-tartans">Revenge of the Tartans</a>: A love letter to the Kingdom series, this project was a 10-day sprint where I was the sole in-engine developer, collaborating with an artist and sound designer to bring it to life.</li>
            <li><a href="https://nickmckinnis.itch.io/drawn-to-dream">Drawn to Dream</a>: As the lead game designer, project manager, pixel artist, and technical animator, I poured my heart into this puzzle platformer. I handled everything from animation states to pixel art animations, all within a tight 10-day deadline.</li>
            <li><a href="https://nickmckinnis.itch.io/cue">Cue</a>: This metroidvania, where I was responsible for the artwork, AI, UI, dialogue, cutscenes, and enemy design, earned 13th place—a testament to the power of a small but mighty team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each project I work on is a step forward in my quest to create games that resonate with players, combining technical prowess with artistic flair. Thank you for visiting, and I hope my work inspires you as much as it does me!</p>
